### How to Play

**Objective**: Draw a path through numbered cells in sequence (1, 2, 3...) and end on the highest number.

**Controls**:
- **Drag** to draw your path through the grid
- **Slide back** along your path to erase (backtrack)
- **Long-press** anywhere to clear the entire path

**Rules**:
1. **Single Shot**: Your solve time is saved after you first play the level, no need to solve the same puzzle repeatedly.
1. **Sequential Access**: You must visit numbered cells in order - you can only reach number 2 after visiting 1, number 3 after visiting 2, etc.
2. **Barriers**: Walls block movement between adjacent cells
3. **Single Path**: Each cell can only be visited once
4. **End Goal**: Complete the puzzle by ending your path on the highest numbered cell

**Difficulty Levels**:
- **Easy**: 5×5 grid with fewer barriers and numbers
- **Medium**: 6×6 grid with moderate complexity
- **Hard**: 7×7 grid with more barriers and numbers

**Features**:
- Click "Solve" to see the solution path
- Click "New" to generate a fresh puzzle
- Solve times are tracked - your first completion of each puzzle counts toward leaderboards
- Share puzzle URLs to challenge friends with the same puzzle
